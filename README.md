# Diabetes-Prediction-Project
In this exploration, our focus centers on the realm of Healthcare and Medical
Analysis, specifically delving into the dynamics of a dataset centered around
diabetes. The initial steps of our investigation involve diligent data preprocessing
techniques, addressing missing values, noise, outliers, and ensuring appropriate
feature scaling. Our goal is to leverage artificial intelligence for predictive
modeling, choosing either a machine learning algorithm or a deep learning model
for the subsequent phases of training and testing predictions. As we navigate this
journey, fine-tuning the model's performance through hyperparameter
adjustments becomes paramount, all while grounding our decisions in a critical
analysis of relevant evaluation metrics. This study aims to unravel insights into
the predictive capabilities of our chosen model within the context of diabetes,
contributing to the broader landscape of healthcare analytics.
